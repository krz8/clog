Stop using CL-FAD.  Use UIOP.

Look at integrating Woo, leads to something comparable to
"hugo server" for preview.  Or, better yet, use Clack with
a Woo implementation.

Use keywords instead of plain symbols in property lists.  Bring in
trivial-types, and then be more explicit with those property lists.
